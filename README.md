## How to play

(Note: You can only play this on laptop 💻 or desktop 🖥️)
  
  * Step 1: Your Game will start after pressing any key
  * Step 2: Remember the button which got blinked when you pressed the key(let us say red)
  * Step 3: Press that button(red in my case)
  * Step 4: As soon as you will press the button, the other button will blink, or may be the same button will blink again( let us say green in my case), now my                 pattern is red, green. So press red then green
  * Step 5: Again another button will blink(let us say green again), so my pattern is red, green, green. So press them in same order from starting.
  * Continue this process....
